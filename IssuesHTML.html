	<h1>Issues </h1>
	<h2> #1: Resources</h2>
	
	<div id="imgr2"><img src="Images/Classroom1.webp"; id="imgr2">Figure 1: Philippines Classroom Shortages: Macasero (2023)</div>
	<p id="floatleft">Firstly, the lack of resources in schools greatly affects the quality of education with many ways. These issues include students
		not learning with their fullest potential since the resources that were given to them were lacking, limited internet connection, limited books to read,
		and lack of classrooms and facilities. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<p id="floatleft">Due to this, there can be a decline of education in the students and the students can have low motivation to study because of these 
		issues. Because when students faces low support and outdated materials, they usually feel disconnected from their education, often leading to cutting classes
		and absents.
	</p>

	<br> <br> <br> <br>

	<h2> #2: Curriculum</h2>
	<div id="imgr3"><img src="Images/k-12img.webp"; id="imgr3">Figure 2: K-12 Curriculum</div>
	<p id="floatright">Now with the curriculum, the curriculum of the Philippines today is the K-12 curriculum. The issues found in the curriculum includes the fact that this
		curriculum is giving students burden, overloading both students and teachers with work and the teachings learned from school differs from actual demands.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p id="floatright">This causes more stress to the students due to the workload, this contradicts the purpose of education, which is to make you love learning new things.
		Students may struggle too with balancing personal life and education. Same goes to teachers, since they are tasked to handle many demands, which hinders their teaching
		ability.
	</p>
	<br> <br> <br> <br>

	<h2> #3: Accessibility</h2>
	<div id="imgr4"><img src="Images/image2.webp"; id="imgr4">Figure 3: Bamban, Tarlac province, Ezra Acayan/Getty Images</div>
	<p id="floatleft"> Some students, especially those who are living in poverty, struggles to earn education. The struggles include not being able to pay for their
		uniforms, notebooks, pens or pencils, and other essential needs for school. This results to students dropping out of school, and even not enrolling to school.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p id="floatleft"> Another factor for bad accessibility to education in the Philippines is the location of where you live. Remote areas, such as mountains, rarely have
		any schools and other educational facilities. This leads to some children not earning any education, and some having to travel far distances in order to just go to school.
